# CSU CS/DS Assignments Repository

Hi! 👋 Welcome to my repository!

This repository contains a collection of coursework assignments  that I authored during my studies at Central South University (CSU). Here, you'll find a comprehensive record of my academic journey in both **C**omputer **S**cience and **D**ata **S**cience fields. If you find any part of this helpful or interesting, I’d be grateful if you could **star** ⭐️ this repository.


 
## About Me

I completed my undergraduate degree in Data Science and Big Data Technology at Central South University's School of Computer Science and Engineering



## Purpose

This repository is a reflection of my learning journey. Looking back at early code may feel embarrassing, but I believe sharing it openly is valuable. By making my coursework assignments public, I hope this repository might offer support to fellow students on similar paths.



## Privacy Notice

Due to the sensitive nature of certain course materials, I’ve chosen not to upload all of them at this time. However, I will gradually upload the remaining parts over time. So please ensure again that you have **starred** ⭐️ this repository to receive any updates. If you need any specific materials, feel free to reach out to me via email.



Thank you 💕 for your visiting!
